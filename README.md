# mecsim_utils
This is a repo to make module that has been made for a range of mecsim FTAC voltammetry AI  systems


# TODO TOMMOROW
- refactor harmonics (Map out the process)
- why is the 3AC not passing AC validation 
    (ISSUE is so many combination it overloads the possible harmonics this needs a fix)
- see if theres a way to remove the currently two FFT's that are done
- validate accuracy
- add unit tests
- optimise the flow

# draft up the SQL stuff (set up databases and rough structure)
SQL
auto capacitance fitting
SOME smart way to lo9ad in files


# TODO
- Confirm the accuracy of the stuff (50:50)

- ADD a check if AC freq amplitude != 0 in INP to mecstracture (VALIDATOR ????)
- MOVE HARM CALC INTO A SINGLE CLASS
- do the windowing
- Finish up the unit tests for this component

# todo before break
GET MECWRITTERV3 working and set up
- get clusteringV2 set up
- get DNN clustering set up
- prototype RL learning

## AIM for weekend do the SQL API

# Do the SQL uploading procedure
